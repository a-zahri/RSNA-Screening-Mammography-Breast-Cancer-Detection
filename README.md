# RSNA-Screening-Mammography-Breast-Cancer-Detection

## Context and Goal of the project
The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) is a non-profit organization that represents 31 radiologic subspecialties from 145 countries around the world. RSNA promotes excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research, and technological innovation.

The goal of this project is to identify breast cancer. The model will be trained with screening mammograms obtained from regular screening.

Improving the automation of detection in screening mammography may enable radiologists to be more accurate and efficient, improving the quality and safety of patient care. It could also help reduce costs and unnecessary medical procedures.
